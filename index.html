					<h1>Communities</h1>
						<p>Powderworkers used to meet in one place only. Now the community meets in more than one place, as the times change and technical community platforms emerge.</p>
						<p>If you are a community of Powderworkers thriving outside of these, you are welcome to mail the webadmin to ask to list your community here.</p>
					<h2>Current</h2>
					<ul class="subtleList">

							<h4>Facebook (public) | <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/991423504241036/" target="_blank">Powderworkers</a> | 2016 - current | 7359 members</h4>
							<span class="remark">
								This Midnight Oil fan page exists to celebrate the music of Midnight Oil and its members, past and present. 
								Its fundamental purpose is to promote equality, positivity, tolerance and happiness through the music of Midnight Oil.
								We, the Powderworkers recognise the inherent dignity and the equal rights of all members of this family called Powderworkers and all peoples of the world.
								We promote equal rights for all genders, all races and religions, their relationships and their connectedness with the Earth we all inhabit.
								We will respect peopleâ€™s individuality and their sense of belonging within this group.
								We will turn down the Mahler and listen to Australian music!

								This is a closed group of mostly past "majordomo" era people in the same style as the Yahoo mail lists but in a Facebook way. Perhaps best thought of an intersection of the Yahoo list and Facebook.

								You are welcome to "airing of grievances and feats of strength" here.  
								Outright bullying and vilification on the other hand are not ok.
